= Serenity (3) for Spring Boot (2) using Cucumber

This PoC is heavily based on the official https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-cucumber-starter[Serenity BDD and Cucumber starter] combined with the https://serenity-bdd.github.io/docs/tutorials/cucumber-screenplay[Serenity Cucumber tutorial]
and the https://serenity-bdd.github.io/docs/screenplay/screenplay_rest[Serenity Screenplay with RESP APIs tutorial].

Under the hood, it's still using _RestAssured_ (so not Spring's `TestRestTemplate`) for calling the local Spring Boot endpoints (instead of using the remote API from the tutorial).

Current stack:

* Serenity BDD 3.4.2
* Cucumber 7.8.1
* RestAssured 5.3.0
* Spring Boot 2.7.5
* JUnit (Vintage) 5.8.2

== Running the tests under Maven

This project comes with just a Maven build script. To run the tests, open a command window and run:

----
mvn clean verify
----

== Viewing the reports

The command provided above will produce a Serenity test report in the `target/site/serenity` directory. Go take a look!
